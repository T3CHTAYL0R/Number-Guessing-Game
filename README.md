# Number Guessing Game
 
A simple number guessing game, where the user sets how high the randomized number will be. Then the user takes a series of guesses and the program will tell you if the random number is higher or lower then the guess. Once the user guesses the random number, the program will tell user how many guesses it took, and if they would 
like to play again.
